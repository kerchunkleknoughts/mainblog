    This is the first entry in a multi part series where
    I dive into the auto hot key script that I use 
    on all of my computers to enhance its core 
    functionality! I believe that since computers 
    are involved in so many parts of our lives, 
    it is very important to become as proficient 
    at using them as possible. 

    so lets begin!

    This command I use quite a bit 
    during web development, it just 
    writes out the command for my 
    templating engine to render 
    the code I wrote.  I have a 
    few others for git commits and 
    other commonly used commands.

    When more advanced debuggers are not available, 
    I use these ahk based debugging blocks. In each 
    function I put a debugging block as seen in the 
    first code snippet, which sets three debug 
    variables. Afterwards, as seen in the second
    code snippet, whenever I want to debug something, 
    I use an ahk debug print statement. If I keep 
    to using these statements, when I am finished 
    debugging a function, I just go back to 
    the debugging block at the start of the function 
    and set the variable to zero. This disables 
    print output and concludes debugging for that function.

    When I am working on large projects that
    start to become very difficult to traverse, 
    I add a few of these code blocks to my 
    ahk script which allow my to instantly ctrl+f 
    search for a given keyword. I usually 
    add references to functions that I frequently 
    return to, such as a main loop or a main 
    state machine. If you notice, there 
    is a send ^a command in the block. This is 
    because when ctrl f is pressed, the previous item 
    searched for will show up. The ^a grabs the text 
    of the previous item, and is followed with a 
    delete command to clear the search field.

    This handy little snippet just outputs whatever 
    text you need at the moment. This is pretty useful 
    if you are writing a report and need to frequently 
    re-reference a string of text that you just 
    dont quite feel like writing over and over again.

      This snippet downloads any image you mouse is

      Very handy for saving memes that you find

      I make heavy usage of windows desktops in order
      to keep my workflow organized. I typically have
      my main task contained in a center desktop, and 
      have supporting materials contained in the left 
      and right desktops. Support materials are 
      often google, reference materials, and more. 

      If the task I am working on gets really complicated, I need
      two sets of these 3 desktop groups. So, I open up 
      task manager in the center desktop in group 1, 
      and snipping tool in group 2. Task manager and snipping tool
      can only have one instance running at a time. 
      
      If you try to open TM when its already running and you
      you are in a different desktop, windows will simply move 
      you over to the desktop in which TM is running. Same goes 
      for snipping tool. 

      By binding numberpad - and NP + to my mouse, I am able 
      to quickly move to a different desktop group.
